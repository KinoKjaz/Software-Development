Software Development

This repository is to hold my course assignments. As I go through this course it will bring a good start for my portfolio going forwards, as well a great place to look back on in the future. Within this repository is the foundation of what my future career is built from.

I grew up in Southern Utah, and would spend most of my time BMX Bike riding until the late evenings. At which time I would spend playing around on Gamemaker, Blender, or gaming in general. I even remember putting together a Website in 7th grade for my friends and I, granted we never ended up using it. Throughout highschool I had stuck to Graphic Art, and 3D design, almost entirely avoiding Code. After Highschool I received a scholarship for a summer camp at SUU which was a great experience in CAD/CAM. My cousin also attended this summer camp, however he was in another program for something along programming, I know he had taken this same course, I am now in, while in highschool. He and I afterwards attended Dixie's CodeCamp, a 24 hour Competition at the time, while he programmed I designed the artwork.

Going forwards I have realised that I want to have the freedom of knowing how to Code effectively, and I have just been holding myself back by not learning earlier. This is my next step forward into a growing industry, and I'm counting on this foundation to hold strong as I take it.
